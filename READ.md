Currently I am onto my first project! 
So far we have learned how to create directory/files and move directories and files within the terminal 
We have learned basic syntax for HTML and how to link and anchor images within our text 


When creating new files ...
    1. git status to check for any files that aren't staged
    2. if files aren't staged and you want to add git type git add "file name"
    3. type git status to make sure file is now staged 
    5. commit all of the files in the staging area by typing "git commit -m "edit file name"
    6.type git status ... "nothing to commit"
    7. git log to look at output and see the entry you made
    . type "git push origin main" to push it to github. 
    9. type git status... it should say "your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. Nothing to commit, working tree clean" 
    10. If you got to git hub it should have the updated work you have done
